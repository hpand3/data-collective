# Data Collective

- [5-minute presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MASnRjDuL_TGLPKlXjSpWDzeJBH6KUoDZ0dmxhWCgJ8/edit?usp=sharing)

Inspired by the access that the European Union GDPR has given us to download our data (eg https://mydatarequest.com/ ) so that we can chose to donate it to causes we care about.

## setup instructions
```
python3 -m venv ENV
source ENV/bin/activate
